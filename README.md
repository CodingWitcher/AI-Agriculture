# AI-Agriculture
Inspired by the potential of Robotics, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision, this project aims to monitor crops for any signs of diseases in real-time. The model was trained on a set of 10,000 field images, using Darkflow( tensorflow adaptation of the original Darknet framework) as the deep neural network in the background, all working in real-time, as a UAV was in reconnaissance mode above the agricultural field. The algorithm was implemented for five classes in a pea plant field(healthy, weed 1 and 2, freezing injury, and soil).


The project got shortlisted for the Proof of Concept(POC) round under MHRD (Ministry of Human Resource and Development, India)’s IIC (Institution’s Innovation Council) zonal round in Indore(India).
